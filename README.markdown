kindle-your-highlights
============
Scrapes highlights from a fully-loaded & downloaded html file from the
"My Highlights" section of kindle.amazon.com.

The original gem (from which this is forked) scraped directly from
kindle.amazon.com, but the My Highlights page is now infinite scroll,
	which I believe Mechanize is unable to handle.

Amazon needs to make an API!! This is far from the ideal solution.

## How to install the gem
Build the gem with
```gem build kindle-your-highlights.gemspec```

Then
```gem install kindle-your-highlights```

* Mechanize
